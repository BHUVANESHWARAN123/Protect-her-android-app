# Protect-her-app

Women's safety is a major concern in our society, and incidents of harassment and violence
against women are unfortunately common. Women often feel unsafe while traveling alone or at night,
and they need a reliable and easy-to-use solution that can help them in such situations. In response to
this problem, we aim to develop an android application that can provide women with a sense of security
and enable them to seek help quickly in case of an emergency. The main goal of the application is to
create a safe and secure environment for women, where they can confidently live their lives without
fear.
